The unimi webapp allows you to download the `.ics` file containing the classes in your academic schedule, but the tricky part is getting the link to the file.

The purpose of this website is to make it easier to get the url of the `ical` format of your timetable to add it as a "calendar subscription" in your device's calendar app.

In this way, your class schedule will be synchronized automatically (e.g. if a lesson is canceled or extra lessons are added, your calendar will be updated) and you will no longer need to use the unimi service to view your timetable.
