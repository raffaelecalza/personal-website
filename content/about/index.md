My name is Raffaele, I was born in 1998 and I'm from Italy. I graduated from the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/) in Computer Science and I'm currently attending the Master in Cyber Security at [University of Milan](https://www.unimi.it/it).

I'm a big fan of Information Technology and Cyber Security. In my spare time I like to study new things and experiment with what I'm studying. I'm a command line guy (as you may have guessed) and a Linux lover. I like to spend hours writing scripts to automate tasks that are repetitive and take me more than 10 minutes. For several years now, I have also been passionate about 3D printing.
